# Ruby Gem - Setup GitHub Packages

## Description

This action will setup Ruby gem access (i.e the `~/.gem/credentials` file) for GitHub Packages. If you're pushing a gem to the same repo as it builds in, all it needs is the default GitHub actions token.

The key is added under the name `github` and we also set environment variables (`GEM_HOST_API_KEY` and `GEM_HOST`) that can be used to push gems. You can do this yourself, but the action is also designed to be used with the [fac/ruby-gem-push-action](https://github.com/fac/ruby-gem-push-action).

## Usage

```yaml
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1 # .ruby-version

    - name: Build Gem
      shell: bash
      run: bundle exec rake build

    - name: Setup GPR
      uses: fac/ruby-gem-setup-github-packages-action@v1
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.github_token }}

    - name: Push Gem
      uses: fac/ruby-gem-push-action@v1
```

If you want to use your own push or other customizations:

```yaml
    - name: Setup GPR
      uses: fac/rubygems-setup-gpr-action@v1
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.package_token }}

    - name: Push Gem
      run: gem push --host "$GEM_HOST" foo.gem
```

## Inputs

### token

The token to be used for authenticating with GitHub packages. If you are pushing a gem to the same repo with a matching name, the default token is enough:

```yaml
with:
   token: ${{ secrets.github_token }}
```

## Outputs

None.
## Environment Variables

### GEM_HOST_API_KEY

Set for the workflow by calling the action. Contains the API key string (prefixed token with Bearer), to access the package repo. Used by `gem push`.

### GEM_HOST

Set for the workflow by calling the action. The host URL for pushing gems to the package repo for the currently building repo.
